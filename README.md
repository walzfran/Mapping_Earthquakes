# Mapping_Earthquakes

#### Purpose of the Challenge 
##### For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a visual to show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. For this we used GeoJSON data from the USGS websire to retreive geographical coordinates and the magnitides of the earthquakes, we then added this data to a map. 
##### I was able to get all of the earthquakes to populate on the map and then create two new layer groups to the map that show the tectonic plates as well as the higher magnitude earthquakes only. I then added a new map layer that shows the terrain, I thought that this depiction on the map might help people who are looking into the earthquakes understand more of where they were happening.
